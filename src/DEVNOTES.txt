Notes for developers
====================

- Distutils2 runs from 2.4 to 3.2 (3.x not implemented yet), so
  make sure you don't use a syntax that doesn't work under
  a specific Python version.

- Always run tests.sh before you push a change. This implies
  that you have all Python versions installed.
