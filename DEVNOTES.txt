Notes for developers
====================

- Distutils2 runs on Python from 2.4 to 3.2 (3.x not implemented yet),
  so make sure you don't use a syntax that doesn't work under
  one of these Python versions.

- Always run tests.sh before you push a change. This implies
  that you have all Python versions installed from 2.4 to 2.7.
