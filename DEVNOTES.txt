Notes for Developers
====================

- Distutils2 has been merged into the CPython repository under the module name
  "packaging", for release with Python 3.3.  The Distutils2 repository is used
  to maintain the backport released on PyPI for older Python versions.  It is
  recommended to work in the CPython repository if possible, but you but you
  can make patches for the Distutils2 repository if you prefer.

  Repo: http://hg.python.org/cpython (default branch)
  More info: http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/Contributing

- Distutils2 runs on Python from 2.4 to 2.7, so make sure you don't use code
  that doesn't work under one of these Python versions.  There is also a
  version compatible with 3.1-3.3 in the "python3" branch.  When merging
  default into python3, please use modern 3.x idioms.

- For 2.4, you need to run "python2.4 setup.py build" before you can try out
  pysetup or run tests (unless you use the runtests.py script which will call
  "setup.py build" automatically).

- Always run tests.sh before you commit a change.  This implies that you have
  all Python versions installed from 2.4 to 2.7.  Be sure to also have docutils
  installed on all Python versions to avoid skipping tests.

- To merge with the Python 3 version, update to the python3 branch, merge and
  run tests.sh to test with Python 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 (you'll need to build the
  last one from source).  If you can't test, let someone else do the merge.

- Don't forget to update CONTRIBUTORS.txt and CHANGES.txt.
