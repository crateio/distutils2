Notes for developers
====================

- Distutils2 runs on Python from 2.4 to 2.7 so make sure you don't use code
  that doesn't work under one of these Python versions.  There is also a
  version compatible with 3.1-3.3 in the "python3" branch.

- For 2.4, you need to run "python2.4 setup.py build" before you can try out
  pysetup or run tests (unless you use the runtests.py script which will call
  "setup.py build" automatically).

- Always run tests.sh before you commit a change.  This implies that you have
  all Python versions installed from 2.4 to 2.7.  Be sure to also have docutils
  installed on all Python versions to avoid skipping tests.
