Notes for developers
====================

- Distutils2 runs on Python from 2.4 to 2.7 so make sure you don't use code
  that doesn't work under one of these Python versions.

- For 2.4, you need to run "python2.4 setup.py build" before you can run tests
  or pysetup.

- Always run tests.sh before you push a change. This implies
  that you have all Python versions installed from 2.4 to 2.7. Be sure to have 
  docutils installed on all python versions no avoid skipping tests as well.
